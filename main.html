  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I love solving challenging problems, building tools that improve peopleâ€™s lives, and continuously learning about new technologies. Creating software offers the unique opportunity to be both creative and logical, and I am excited by the potential to work collaboratively with others, turn ideas into reality, and make a meaningful impact in the world.
